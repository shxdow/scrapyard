      <ul class = "text-justify">
        <li><b>1943</b> - Born in Chicago, Illinois, U.S.</li>
        <li><b>1956</b> - Won a "brilliancy" that became known as "The Game of the Century".</li>
        <li><b>1958</b> - Became both the youngest grandmaster up to that time and the youngest candidate for the World Championship.</li>
        <li><b>1956</b> - Won the U.S. Junior Chess Championship, scoring 8½/10 at Philadelphia to become the youngest-ever Junior Champion at age 13.</li>
        <li><b>1960</b> - Fischer tied for first place with Soviet star Boris Spassky at the strong Mar del Plata Tournament in Argentina, winning by a two-point margin, scoring 13½/15 (+13−1=1),ahead of David Bronstein. </li>
        <li><b>1962</b> -  He was the first non-Soviet player to win an Interzonal since FIDE instituted the tournament in 1948.</li>
        <li><b>1962 / 1963</b> -  Fischer experienced his first single-game loss (to Edmar Mednis) in round one.</li>
        <li><b>1963 / 1964</b> -  Fischer achieved his second perfect score, this time against the top-ranked chess players in the country: "This tournament became, as they say, the stuff of legend.</li>
        <li><b>1964</b> - Eligible as U.S. Champion, decided against his participation in the 1964 Amsterdam Interzonal, taking himself out of the 1966 World Championship cycle,even after FIDE changed the format of the eight-player Candidates Tournament from a round-robin to a series of knockout matches, which eliminated the possibility of collusion.</li>
        <li><b>1972</b> - After the 1972 World Chess Championship, Fischer did not play a competitive game in public for nearly 20 years.In 1977, he played three games in Cambridge, Massachusetts against the MIT Greenblatt computer program, winning all of them.</li>
        <li><b>1981</b> -  Fischer was arrested by a police patrolman, allegedly because Fischer matched the description of a man who had just committed a bank robbery in the area. Fischer, who alleged that he was slightly injured during the arrest,said that he was held for two days, subjected to assault and various types of mistreatment, and released on $1,000 bail.</li>
        <li><b>2008</b> - Dies at the age of 64. </li>
